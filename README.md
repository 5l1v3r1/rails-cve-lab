# CVE testing for Ruby on Rails

Sandboxing different Ruby on Rails versions with Docker, to assist with penetration testing and CVE research.

To build a new rails image, pinned to a specific version:

    $ CVE=CVE-2019-5418 RAILS_VERSION=5.2.1 make clean build

To run it locally, for testing:

    $ CVE=CVE-2019-5418 make server

This should spin up the container and make it available on localhost:3000
